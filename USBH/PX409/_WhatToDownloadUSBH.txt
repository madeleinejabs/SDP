	from your USBH sensor.  Also, supports the following non USBH products: TJ-USB, IR-USB, RH-USB, 
	UTC-USB, and PX409-USB (legacy product).  Also supports PX409-495 series.

"Omega Products dotNET API x.x.x.zip": Download this if you will be writing your own application software for 
	.NET, and want to use Omega's free .NET API.

"Omega USBH Transducer Command Reference RevX A025002.pdf": Download this if you will be writing a software
 	application to directly interface with the Omega USBH device through the serial port. This is a reference 
	document that details the USBH commands and port settings.

"Omega IN-USBH Calibration App x.x.x.zip": Download this file if you have an Omega IN-USBH product and want 
	to field calibrate it yourself. This App ONLY works with the IN-USBH product; all other USBH products are 
	not field calibratable.  If you use the free "Omega USBH Application", you do not need to download this 
	App, as the Omega USBH Application includes field calibration functionality for IN-USBH.
